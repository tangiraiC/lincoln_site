     first-letter:float-start">Hello! I’m <bold>Lincoln T Chanakira</bold>, a passionate 
     Full Stack Developer
and Data Scientist with a unique story that spans continents and industries.
 I was born and raised in the rural heart of Mhondoro, Zimbabwe, where I first 
 cultivated my curiosity for technology and problem-solving. From a young age, 
 I demonstrated leadership qualities, serving as Head Boy at both Nyatsambo 
 Primary School and Ndarama High School in Masvingo, where I developed a 
 strong foundation in academics and community service.</p>

     first-letter:me-3 first-letter:float-start">Driven by a desire to bridge business and technology,
      I pursued a Bachelor’s
 degree in Business Studies and Computer Science at the University of Zimbabwe
  (UZ). This blend of business acumen and technical skills laid the groundwork
   for my current studies, as I work toward a Master’s in Analytics at the 
   Kogod School of Business, American University.</p>

      first-letter:me-3 first-letter:float-start">My professional journey has been diverse and enriching. I gained valuable 
experience as an IT Audit Intern at NetOne Cellular, one of Zimbabwe’s 
leading telecommunications companies. There, I focused on assessing IT
 systems, identifying risks, and ensuring compliance, 
 which deepened my understanding of IT governance and security. Later, I 
 transitioned into the travel industry, excelling as a Travel Consultant and 
 Marketing Analyst for Angeliana Travel and Airline Pros International
 . These roles allowed me to merge my analytical skills with a passion for
  customer service and marketing, helping businesses make data-driven decisions
   to enhance their market reach.</p>

     proudly supporting Manchester 
City. I enjoy playing the sport whenever I get the chance. My life is also 
guided by strong faith and a commitment to giving back; I actively participate 
in charity events and volunteer with 
organizations like Amore Learning, where I help foster educational 
opportunities for underprivileged children.</p>

I got scammed—a reminder that entrepreneurship is full of unexpected twists!</p>
